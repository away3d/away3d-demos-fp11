AWD export in deep

AWD is a great and light plugins for export object from max 
let's see some usefull trick you have to know for best use.

1*/ FOREST _ the link 
awd don't export multyMaterial, imagine you want make a tree 
Trunk , leaves and flower don't have the same texture they need different mesh for each.
but we also need simple methode for placing tree.

First create a new AEC floriage in 3dsmax, remove leaves and flower 
Make a 2 copy of this tree for leaves and flowers 

We have 3 mesh Foliage001 for trunk and branches
Foliage002 for leaves and Foliage003 for Flowers

now link Foliage002 and Foliage003 to Foliage001.
(double click on trunk select all tree).

Export this model in awd 
remove awd option Include skinning data in Scene & Geometry
remove all in material and all in animation.

Now in away3d you just have to import and add to scene Foliage001
use Foliage002 and Foliage003 name to change material.

now you can clone move or rotate you tree simply with Foliage001 other mesh is link to trunk
note: don't add to scene other mesh or you lose link and see this mesh at 0,0,0 

see script exemple Basic_Tree.as


2°/ STILL LIFE _ smooth mesh UV
one of best technics is low polygone modelisation.
imagine you want make a still life with some fruits and cup.

first create a simple apple (basic sphere 8 face) and make simple uv like

apply TurboSmooth modifier and select Explicit Normal if you don't select this option
in away3d you see bad line in the end of uv 

add a noise modifier to add some different seed for clones.

for cup use simple modelisation and twofold symmetry 
apply turboSmooth with Explicit Normal.
