// TODO.
- remove 3d star objects ( replaced by starling starfield )
- remove 3d skybox ( replaced by starling image )
- remove 3d hit explosions ( replaced by starling explosions )

// Bugs.
- bg on mobile is white, shows for an instant when app loads

// Performance improvements.


// Code improvements.
- move creation stuff from invader scene to pools?
- remove text += warnings
- some pools for simple objects look to much alike, use inheritance and remove some classes
- transfer player motion code to Player?
- tidy up invader scene again

// To consider.
- change invader materials as they get hit, there is no way to change the materials of clones tho without changing the base material
- change ui button down sound, feels weird
- move all invader constants stuff ( per type ) to invader definitions class
- stabilize ( average ) accelerometer input
- implement invader spawn sound?
