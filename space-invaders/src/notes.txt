// TODO.
- motherships take more than 1 hit to die, they are heavy and shoot very fast

// Bugs.
- bg on mobile is white, shows for an instant when app loads

// Performance improvements.
- star objects are very inefficient, implement with fragment shader on a plane?
- skybox is overkill since you can only see 1 image?

// To consider.
- transfer player motion code to Player?
- stabilize ( average ) accelerometer input
- invaders fire at player, not straight forward
- rate of fire of invaders increases with level
- tested: ( realistic tilt ) player motion yaws when moving sideways and tilts when moving vertically - results a bit confusing
- projectiles hit projectiles?
- Greg could you help me make some sort of portal where the invaders come from in my demo?
and perhaps also a similar particle animation for invader or player hits
[7/16/12 8:44:40 PM] Alejandro Santander: should be simple and add a lot to it!
- introduce side motion on invaders :: could make hitting invaders quite annoying _____ BUT! perhaps different invaders could move more or less, attaching this diff to score
- implement invader spawn sound?
