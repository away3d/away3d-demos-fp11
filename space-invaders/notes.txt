// IMPORTANT.
- TODO: touch controls suck!
- TODO: handle stage resizing in 3D view
- TODO: implement UI as regular sprites
- TODO: implement UI with starling ----> http://www.geepers.co.uk/?page_id=587, pass "badoing"
- TODO: projectiles wonder too far
- TODO: try Rob's skybox
- TODO: implement high score persistence

// BUGS.
- TODO: invader projectiles are no longer visible
- TODO: weird line on player projectiles
- TODO: sorting artifact on android
- TODO: invader creation randomness sucks - probabilities are weird, sometimes the same object keeps appearing, etc

// Gameplay improvement.
- TODO: different invader types have
- TODO: add bomb objects ( which explode on click )
- TODO: fire on and fire off cycles on invaders?
- TODO: invaders cause damage on player?

// Performance improvement.
- TODO: star objects are very inefficient

// Code improvement.
- TODO: projectile and star pools look almost the same, generalize classes
- TODO: move warp in to lower class? invader and stars use it
- TODO: remove not needed picking from invaders
- TODO: tidy up InvaderScene.as
- TODO: remove InvaderVO, it's confusing

// To consider.
- TODO: introduce side motion on invaders :: could make hitting invaders quite annoying _____ BUT! perhaps different invaders could move more or less, attaching this diff to score
- TODO: do not allow invaders to wonder too close?
- TODO: replace spawn probabilities with timers?
- TODO: implement invader spawn sound?
