// BUGS.
- TODO: game over screen is not visible on android ( although you can click the invisible replay button )

// Performance improvement.
- TODO: star objects are very inefficient
- TODO: skybox is overkill since you can only see 1 image?

// To consider.
- TODO: introduce side motion on invaders :: could make hitting invaders quite annoying _____ BUT! perhaps different invaders could move more or less, attaching this diff to score
- TODO: do not allow invaders to wonder too close?
- TODO: implement invader spawn sound?
- TODO: implement UI with starling?
- TODO: add bomb objects ( which explode on click or something like that )
- TODO: fire on and fire off cycles on invaders?
- TODO: invaders cause damage on player?
